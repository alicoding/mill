# E2e quarantine register (goal 0080)

The committed record replacing the "known flakes" folklore list that
used to circulate in agent-brief prose. Protocol (testing.md): a test
observed flaking twice enters here with class, owner, and review
date, and gets `@flaky` in its title — or gets fixed instead. Entries
leave by fix (preferred) or by their review date forcing a decision.
Retry-passing is NOT a fix.

Classes: **live-run** = polls a real workflow run's terminal status
(inherently timing-sensitive under contention); **interaction-race**
= geometry/pointer race with a known standing-helper fix;
**unclear** = no identified signature yet — first recurrence gets a
trace (now auto-captured on retry).

| composition-canvas-interactions.spec.ts:25 | interaction-race | 2026-08-17 | 2026-09-17 | clickCanvasNode's own toPass retry loop times out ("element is outside of the viewport" across every retry) selecting the upstream node before the Inspector-composed drag; reproduces in isolation and pre-existing on unmodified main (unrelated to goal 0081 slice A3), not yet traced |
| composition-canvas-interactions.spec.ts:92 | CI-only skip | 2026-08-15 | goal 0069's revisit clause | the one honest skip; four fix layers recorded. Reproduced LOCALLY too as of 2026-08-16 (2/2 attempts, on both the pre- and post-0080-burn-down code -- not a burn-down regression), contradicting the in-file comment's "every local mode... passes 10/10"; that comment needs a re-check, not yet done here |

## Fixed (pattern applied)

Entries below left the active register on this date, fixed by applying
`waitForViewportStable` (`frontend/e2e/fixtures/animation.ts`, goal
0080's burn-down) at the interaction-race site, not by a retry pass.

| Spec:line | Class | Fixed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| live-run-state.spec.ts:87 | interaction-race | 2026-08-16 | connectNodes now waits for the viewport transform to settle before the hover-based drag |
| atlas-scale.spec.ts (first attempt) | interaction-race | 2026-08-16 | boundingBox-then-act sequences after the initial fitView and both drills now wait for viewport stability first |
| step-detail-overlay.spec.ts:99 | interaction-race | 2026-08-16 | the in-file settle helper promoted into fixtures/animation.ts; the double-click path already called it |

## atlas-select-group.spec.ts (box-drag test only — test.fixme)
- **Class**: pointer-coalescing on synthesized drags (the config
  header's documented class) — the shift-drag box select is the
  app's ONLY multi-select door (plain click glances, meta-click
  opens per the locked gesture map), and React Flow samples deltas
  between real pointermove events, so synthesized moves coalesce
  into a rectangle it never registers. Coin-flip even solo; fails
  CI shards 3/3.
- **Entered**: 2026-08-17. **Review**: 2026-08-31.
- **Status**: test.fixme (runs nowhere) — NOT retry-tolerated,
  because it fails both CI retries when it fails.
- **Coverage ledger**: the selection-overlay context-menu fix this
  spec was written for is probe-proven live (menu opens, "Group
  into new area" present, New-area popover completes) and the
  selection-preservation half is covered by the containment spec.
  The full gesture chain's check is the manual-only registry entry
  in .claude/rules/testing.md (box-select → right-click → group).
- **Investigated and ruled out**: menu-animation race, same-port
  server race, test budget (180s also consumed), file-worker
  interference, deterministic click-selection (impossible at entry
  time — the gesture map assigned click/meta-click elsewhere).
- **Update (goal 0092)**: shift-CLICK toggle joined the gesture map
  (multiSelectionKeyCode), which IS deterministically synthesizable
  — the same spec file's shift-click test now CI-proves the full
  select → member-right-click → Group chain and Delete-over-
  selection. Only the box-drag SYNTHESIS remains quarantined; its
  live check stays in testing.md's manual registry.
