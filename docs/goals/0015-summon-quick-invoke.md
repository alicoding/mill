# 0015 — Summon quick-invoke: the palette that teaches you to skip it

## Goal
Owner-endorsed (2026-08-10) as the value mirror's companion (goal
0014): a command-palette quick-invoke — "super useful when you want a
quick trigger and don't remember which key, and it shows you that
next time you can do this instead," plus the standard personalization
pattern (frequently-used float up, pinned, configurable).

## Design direction
- **⌘K in-window palette** (industry-standard) built on Primer's
  `FilteredActionList` — already named in .claude/rules/frontend.md
  as "fits a command-palette-style picker," unused until now. The
  §3.7 OS summon hotkey opens the window INTO the palette.
- Each row: workflow + its **trigger identity inline** — the
  assigned hotkey combo (the Raycast education loop: the palette is
  the on-ramp, the hotkey is the destination), armed state for
  schedule/watch, "callable" demoted. Enter = the same run semantics
  as the list-row Run (test kind; consistency over cleverness).
- Pending-review count surfaces in the palette (goal 0005 tie-in).
- **Frecency + pins**: frequency/recency ranking from local run
  history — THE SAME substrate as goal 0014's value mirror (one
  usage-stats capability feeds both; build it once). Pinned
  workflows float; personalization config lives with 0014's
  preferences (per-workflow minutes-saved, notification opt-ins).

## Sequencing
Pairs with 0014; the shared usage-stats read layer is the common
prerequisite — whichever of the two goals goes first builds it.

## Acceptance
Owner summons, types three letters, runs a workflow — and the row
they picked showed them the hotkey they'll use instead next time;
their most-used workflows are already at the top without configuring
anything.
